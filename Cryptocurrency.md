# ₿ Awesome Crypto Currency Tools & Algorithms

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kennethreitz/awesome-coins.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/kennethreitz/awesome-coins)
[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

From Wikipedia—
> A [cryptocurrency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.

There are many algorithms used in many different crypto–currencies. This document serves to provide a simple map to reference which are for what, as well as provide a nice list of helpful services and utilities for managing coins.

## So, Before We Begin…

Some of this "coin" stuff may be confusing, if you're new. So, let me explain what I know so far — 

There are many, many [coins](http://coinbin.org/coins). People like to [trade](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=kennethreitz) them, not unlike stocks or Pokémon cards. People also like to [mine](https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=386829) them, using their home computers or specialized hardware.

Coins are stored in wallets. These can be hosted online, on your local computer, or even on a sheet of paper.

It's hard to mine a coin on your own, and is a bit like gambling, so people usually opt to join a pool (which typically use the `stratum` protocol to coordinate) — this rewards you for your work, even if you didn't find anything, because you helped contribute with thousands of other people, some of whom did find blocks. The blocks are then split up, based on the pool's rules.

Some people [rent hashing power](https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=386829) from farms and either play the "blockchain lottery", trying to find blocks of coins on their own, or they point the farm at a pool, like a typical home miner — except they have a tremendously high amount of computational power available to them, if they're willing to pay for it.

Hope that helps clear things up.

### Exchanges

[Where to store bitcoins](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

For other cryptocurrencies, it's best to use their own wallet (usually from their site, i.e. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) or [Dash](https://www.dash.org/wallet/))

I found no way to buy bitcoin anonymously, by adequate rate, outside of US and EU, and for USD or Euros. If you know the way, please contact me [here](https://t.me/tmaniac).
